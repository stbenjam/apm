#!/usr/bin/env bash
# merge_gate_wait.sh -- poll the GitHub Checks API for a list of expected
# required checks on a given SHA and emit a single pass/fail verdict. Used
# by .github/workflows/merge-gate.yml as the orchestrator's core logic.
#
# Why this script exists:
#   GitHub's required-status-checks model is name-based, not workflow-based.
#   When the underlying workflow fails to dispatch (transient webhook
#   delivery failure on 'pull_request'), the required check stays in
#   "Expected -- Waiting" forever and the PR is silently stuck. This script
#   turns that ambiguous yellow into an unambiguous red after a bounded
#   liveness window, so reviewers see a real failure with a real message.
#
#   It also lets us collapse N separately-required checks into a single
#   required gate (Tide / bors pattern). Branch protection only requires
#   "Merge Gate / gate"; this script verifies all underlying checks.
#
# Inputs (environment variables):
#   GH_TOKEN          required. Token with 'checks:read' for the repo.
#   REPO              required. owner/repo (e.g. microsoft/apm).
#   SHA               required. Head SHA to poll (PR head, merge_group temp
#                     branch head, or workflow_dispatch-resolved PR head).
#   EXPECTED_CHECKS   required. Comma-separated list of check-run names to
#                     wait for. Whitespace around commas is trimmed.
#                     Example: "Build & Test (Linux),Build (Linux)"
#   EVENT_NAME        optional. The triggering event ('pull_request',
#                     'merge_group', 'workflow_dispatch'). Used only to
#                     emit the right recovery instructions on timeout.
#   TIMEOUT_MIN       optional. Total wall-clock budget in minutes.
#                     Default: 30.
#   POLL_SEC          optional. Poll interval in seconds. Default: 30.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all expected checks completed with success | skipped | neutral
#   1  at least one expected check completed with a failing conclusion
#   2  at least one expected check never appeared within TIMEOUT_MIN
#      (THE BUG we catch -- dropped 'pull_request' webhook)
#   3  at least one expected check appeared but did not complete in time
#   4  invalid arguments / environment
